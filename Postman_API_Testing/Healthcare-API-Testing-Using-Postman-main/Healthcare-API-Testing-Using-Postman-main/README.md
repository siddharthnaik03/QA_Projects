# Healthcare-API-Testing-Using-Postman

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end API testing and automation for a Healthcare Appointment Management system using Postman, Newman, and data-driven testing.
The workflow simulates a real healthcare system where patients are created, appointments are scheduled, updated, and deleted through REST APIs following the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard.
The project focuses on validating API functionality, response integrity, automation execution, and report generation.

## 🎯 Objectives
•	Perform CRUD API testing for healthcare resources

•	Implement data-driven API automation

•	Validate API responses using assertions

•	Chain requests dynamically using environment variables

•	Execute automated tests via CLI

•	Generate professional HTML automation reports


## 🧰 Technology and tools 
•	Postman — API testing & scripting

•	Newman — Command line automation runner

•	FHIR Healthcare API (HAPI Server)

•	CSV (Data-Driven Testing)

•	Newman HTML Extra Reporter

## 🔄 Test Workflow (End-to-End Flow)
1.	✅ Create Patient
2.	✅ Fetch Patient Details
3.	✅ Create Appointment
4.	✅ Update Appointment
5.	✅ Delete Appointment
Dynamic IDs are captured and reused between requests using environment variables.
